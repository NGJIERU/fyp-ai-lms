# FYP Presentation: AI-Powered Intelligent Learning Management System

## Section 1: Introduction

### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Project Title:** AI-Powered Intelligent Learning Management System
- **Subtitle:** A Next-Generation Platform for Adaptive Learning & Automated Content Curation
- **Context:** Final Year Project (FYP)

### Slide 2: Background & Motivation
* **Context:**
    * Learning Management Systems (LMS) are essential for modern education but often struggle with **maintaining up-to-date materials** and **adapting to diverse learner needs**.
    * "Traditional LMS platforms struggle to address these issues effectively, leading to a push for more adaptive and personalized solutions." (Spriggs et al., 2025).
* **Citation:**
    * *Spriggs, K., Lau, M. C., & Passi, K. (2025). Personalizing education through an adaptive LMS with integrated LLMs [Preprint]. arXiv.*
* **Project Aim:**
    * To address these gaps by integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for:
        1.  **Automated content updating** (fixing the "outdated materials" issue).
        2.  **Personalized learning support** (fixing the "one-size-fits-all" issue).
    * **Goal:** Enhance the efficiency, relevance, and user experience of the LMS.

### Slide 3: Problem Analysis (Current Limitations)
* **The "Static Content" Problem:**
    * Traditional LMSs are passive repositories. Content is only as good as the last manual upload.
* **The "Fragmented Learning" Issue:**
    * Students leave the LMS to find better explanations on YouTube/Stack Overflow, losing context and tracking.
* **Lecturer Bandwidth:**
    * Lecturers cannot physically provide 24/7 personalized tutoring or constantly search for new relevant papers/videos for every topic.
* **Lack of Remediation:**
    * Generic feedback (e.g., scoring 50%) is not helpful without a personalized path to improvement (e.g., "Watch this specific video on Recursion").

### Slide 4: Proposed Solution & Objectives
- **Objective 1: Centralized Intelligence (Automated Updating)**
    - **Goal:** Aggregate high-quality external resources (YouTube, GitHub, arXiv) and map them semantically to the syllabus.
    - **Tech:** Custom Crawlers + Semantic Embedding Matching.
- **Objective 2: Personalized AI Tutoring (Learning Support)**
    - **Goal:** Provide 24/7 intelligent support that understands the *specific* course context.
    - **Tech:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline.
- **Objective 3: Adaptive Learning Loop**
    - **Goal:** Close the learning gap by actively identifying weak topics and pushing relevant recommendations.
    - **Tech:** Tracking Engine + Quality Scoring.

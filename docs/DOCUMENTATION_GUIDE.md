# SECTION 13 — DOCUMENTATION

## 13.1 Documentation Suite

### **What does README explain?**
The root `README.md` is the **Single Source of Truth** for any new visitor. It covers:
1.  **Project Title & Pitch:** "What is this?" (AI-Powered LMS).
2.  **Quick Start:** "How do I run it?" (`docker-compose up`).
3.  **Architecture:** High-level diagram.
4.  **Links:** Pointers to detailed docs in `docs/`.

### **How does someone run this project?**
*   **Prerequisites:** Docker & Docker Compose.
*   **Command:** `docker-compose up --build`.
*   **Access:**
    *   Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    *   Backend API: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### **What diagrams exist?**
*   **System Architecture:** (Mermaid/Excalidraw) in `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
*   **Database Schema:** (ER Diagram) in `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`.
*   **User Flow:** (Sequence Diagrams) in `docs/FRONTEND_DESIGN.md`.

### **How is API documented?**
*   **Swagger UI (OpenAPI):** Automatically generated by FastAPI at `/docs`.
*   **Redoc:** Alternative view at `/redoc`.
*   **Interactive:** You can `Try it out` directly in the browser without writing curl commands.

### **What assumptions are documented?**
*   **Scope:** Defined in `SCOPE_AND_DEFINITION.md` (e.g., "We only support English language content").
*   **Scale:** "Designed for <10,000 users" (Monolith architecture).
*   **Availability:** "OpenAI API must be reachable".

### **How does documentation reduce onboarding cost?**
*   **Self-Service:** A new developer can read `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md` to set up their `.env` without interrupting the lead developer.
*   **Context:** `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` prevents them from breaking the build with bad commits.
*   **Safety:** `SECURITY.md` prevents them from committing AWS keys.

Project scaffolding
Created the FastAPI project layout (app/, 
app/main.py
, app/api/, app/models/, app/schemas/, app/core/).
Added requirements.txt with exact version pins for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL driver, JWT, password hashing, etc.
Set up alembic.ini and an initial Alembic migration script.
Configuration
Implemented app/core/config.py with environment‑aware settings (host, port, DB URI, JWT secret, token expiry).
Adjusted the DB connection to use the local PostgreSQL user (jieru_0901) and created the lms_db database.
Database layer
Defined the User model (and a placeholder Course model) in app/models/.
Added Base and session handling in app/core/database.py.
Pydantic schemas
UserCreate, UserRead, Token, TokenData in app/schemas/ for request validation and response shaping.
Security utilities
Password hashing (bcrypt via passlib) and verification.
JWT creation and decoding (app/core/security.py).
Dependency injection
app/api/deps.py provides get_current_user, get_current_active_superuser, etc., to protect routes.
API endpoints
Auth routes (/api/v1/auth/register, /api/v1/auth/login) handling registration, password hashing, and token issuance.
User routes (/api/v1/users/me) returning the authenticated user’s profile.
All endpoints are mounted under app/api/v1/api.py and included in the main FastAPI app.
Database migrations
Ran Alembic to generate and apply the initial migration, creating the users (and courses) tables.
Testing & verification
Fixed dependency conflicts (downgraded pytest, added email-validator).
Created manual_test_auth.py and verify_module.py scripts that:
Register a user,
Log in to obtain a JWT,
Call the protected /users/me endpoint,
Print “All tests passed” on success.
Ran the scripts successfully; both registration and authentication work.
Verified the API via FastAPI’s interactive docs (/docs) and curl commands.
Debugging & fixes
Resolved the “address already in use” issue by running the server on port 8001.
Fixed the PostgreSQL connection error by creating the lms_db database and updating the connection string.
Adjusted requirements.txt and re‑installed dependencies to eliminate version conflicts.
All core pieces of the User Access Management module—registration, login, JWT‑based authentication, role handling, and profile retrieval—are now functional and verified. The next logical step would be to start the Course & Syllabus Management module, but let me know if you’d like anything else clarified or any additional tweaks.
